RubiksCube
==========
This repository has the code for a virtual Rubik's Cube application that was built in python. It was the culmination
of a Software Design project I worked on with four other team members.

The program gives you the option to either play with an existing Rubik's Cube or to load your own cube into the program.
If you choose to load your own cube into the program, you are prompted to take pictures of your Rubik's Cube, while
the interface indicates which color side to show and how to orient it. After you take pictures of all the sides, the 
cube forms in Visual Python. This is done using the SimpleCV module, which uses color recognition software to determine
the colors on the faces of the cube. On the team, I specifically worked on designing this interface.

If you want to use the existing cube, there is an interface that gives you multiple options for interacting with
the cube. There are buttons to rotate the cube in each direction, and to rotate it into different views. There are 
options to randomize and fully solve the cube.

SimpleCV and Visual Python need to be downloaded to make the software run.
