RubiksCube
==========
This repository is of a virtual Rubik's Cube application I worked with a team on in a Software Design class.

When the program is initiated, you are given an option between playing with an existing cube or loading your own
cube into the program. If you choose to load your own cube into the program, the module SimpleCV is used for color
recognition software as you take pictures of your cube. The interface indicates which color side you should use and
how it should be oriented. After you take pictures of all the sides, the cube forms in Visual Python.

If using the existing cube, there is an interface that allows you to turn, rotate, randomize, or fully solve the cube.

SimpleCV and Visual Python need to be downloaded to make the software run.
